### Hey, I'm Hyphen ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I'm currently on a gap hay (half a year).
I spend a lot of time contemplating and exploring myself, reflecting on the origins of life. I recognize the precious value of time for myself, and sharing it with others is truly wonderful. I give considerable thought to the benefits of leading an organized and disciplined life. Interestingly, I am flexible and highly adaptable. I believe that God doesn't want me to become a superman.

ðŸ§© I have created a new Git account as a significant step, a clear milestone in my journey to enhance my technological capabilities. Embracing new technological knowledge, I am not only aiming to become an excellent software engineer but also carrying a strong belief that in the not-too-distant future, I will contribute to resolving financial challenges in building and maintaining a technological product. I believe this will be the final hurdle in my journey.

`Check me out! ðŸ”­`
